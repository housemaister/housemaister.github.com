Hello World.

I'm playing a little bit with this octopress installation.

Very important is to use the correct environment:
```
rvm use 1.9.2
```


In order to get the changes up to github, I have to type the following commands
```
rake generate
rake deploy
```
To commit the changes I have to do
```
git add .
git commit -m 'your message'
git push origin source
```
